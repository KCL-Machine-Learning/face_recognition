Face Recognition
---

Attempting to build a model to perform face recognition.
Taking Siamese Network for One Shot Image Verification paper's approach
and applying it with a small face dataset.

In the first attempt the best validation accuracy lies around 0.225 and evaluation
accuracy is 0.125 for the one shot tasks.

The dataset is small and FaceLoader is not very effective at the moment making
the training very slow and not very accurate.
